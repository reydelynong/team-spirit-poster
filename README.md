# CCIS Phantoms — Team Spirit Poster (Repository)

## Contents
- `poster_generator.py` — simple Python script (Pillow) that loads the poster assets from `assets/` and adds a bottom credit banner, producing `combined_<asset>.png`.
- `assets/` — contains the two poster images generated for the CCIS Phantoms (if available).
- `README.md` — this file.

## Concept & Theme
**Team:** CCIS Phantoms  
**Primary Color:** Pink (with black and white accents)  
**Slogan:** "Unseen but Unstoppable"  
**Values:** Teamwork • Innovation • Excellence

The posters use a dark-to-pink gradient background, a mysterious phantom mascot with glowing pink highlights, and bold, high-contrast typography to create energy and team spirit while keeping the 'phantom' aesthetic mysterious and powerful.

## How to use
1. Install dependencies (recommended):
```
pip install pillow
```
2. Run the generator script from the repository root:
```
python poster_generator.py
```
This will create `combined_<asset>.png` files that include a small bottom banner with credits.

## License & Credits
The poster artwork images in `assets/` were generated during an interactive design session. Use them for your class project and presentations. If you publish or share them externally, please credit the original designer (your team) and specify they were AI-assisted designs.
